## Dell XPS 13 9315

Special keys:

- `F2`: BIOS
- `F12`: boot menu

Boot on the bootable USB:

1. Disable UEFI in the BIOS
2. Go to boot menu
3. Select UEFI Mass Storage XXX 2 (USB icon)

## Installation issue

After the USB boot, the installation process may fail.
It is still possible to download again the OS image and copy to another USB key from the running virtual OS.
It seems the Corsair USB key works in any situation.

## TODO

- Update Mega sync config
- Link to NextDNS
- Install LightBurn
- Install Firefoo
- Connect to Yubikey
